{"name":"Mini-NDN Integration Tests","tagline":"","body":"### Team Members\r\n\r\nVince Lehman (@vslehman), Davide Pesavento (@Pesa), Eric Newberry (@eric135)\r\n\r\n### Problem Statement\r\n\r\nCurrently, the NFD integration tests can take hours to run using either Vagrant or Emulab. It would be helpful to the project if integration tests could be run more efficiently and in a much shorter time on Mini-NDN. In addition, this new testing infrastructure could potentially be integrated with Jenkins to test for breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### Approach\r\n\r\nTo effectively use each team member's skills, we worked simultaneously on two tasks:\r\n\r\nVince and Davide worked to get the testing infrastructure and the integration tests working on Mini-NDN.\r\n\r\nEric worked to optimize the Vagrant tests for comparison against the Mini-NDN infrastructure. This was accomplished by eliminating the bottleneck of installing Boost and the NDN libraries and packages four separate times. Now, these steps are executed once on a template VM. This is then cloned for each of the four NDN nodes in the testing environment.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n**TODO**\r\n\r\nThe optimizations have reduced the running time of the Vagrant environment significantly. Instead of taking three or four hours, the integration tests now take just under an hour and a half to run.\r\n\r\n### TODOs\r\n\r\n**The TODOs are TODO**\r\n\r\n### Future\r\n\r\n**TODO**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
